The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a site map and it will show how those pages can be grouped. A site map will usually begin with the homepage. Additionally, if the site is large and is compartmentalized into sections, each section might require its own section homepage to link to all of the information within it.
