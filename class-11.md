Today our read will be about assorted intresting topics , so let's get started 

# Images, 

As we have talked earlier CSS allow us endles possiblities in regards to designing and builiding a webpage in amoong these possibilities is the fact that add, shape, resize images to our will as we please, it might seem tricky at first but it's very simple once we understand the rules that CSS follows and we can enforce them in our design with ease

first of all we have the **width** and **hight** properties that we can control with how many pixels we want them to be, and by doing so, it will make the webpage run run smoothly becasue it will tell the browser how much space to leave for the image while the browser is still rendering the webpage without waiting for the image to download,

in addition to that we can align images using CSS using many properties like the **float** property, or we can use different classes like **align-left** or **align-right** to align the image to the right or left of the page 

also we can center the image by turning it from inline to block element, and from here there two options we can follow the first is using **text-align** with value to the center or we can use margin property and set the values of left and right to auto 

not only we can add images to the webpage as an element of the webpage but we can also add a background image by adding an image url to the body and selecting an **background-image**, then the image will repeat itself to fill the entire webpage, 

and we can control how it repeats to our liking, like **repeat-x** which will the image repeat horizontally m and the **repeat-y** which will the image repeat vertically, also we have **no-repeat** which will the image repeat once , and of course there's **fixed** and **scroll**

in addition to everything mentioned above, we can add colors and effects other than images to our design like the gradients tool, or manipulate the contrast
