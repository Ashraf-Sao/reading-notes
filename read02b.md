Git Tutorial

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source   

    * git init — initializes a repository. 
     * git checkout — checks out a branch from repository into the working directory. 
    * git add — adds a change in a file to a change set. 
    * git commit — commits a change set from the working directory into the repository.
    * git push origin main - command updates the remote repository with local commits.

keep in mind that Git was created for Linux development; most projects have a single relationship with the remote server. So, first, it's an so powerful to use, like trying to kill a  fly with a canon. Second, because of its power, it's extremely complicated and makes it really easy to confuse yourself with it.
