# Introduction to React and Components

Hello to 301, today I will be talking about React and Components, 

## What is a component?

A component is reusable and/or replaceable set of functions that helps implement or export these functionalities to a higher level of interface, however it is still a software intended to interact with with other components,

it can be viewed in three different ways 

- *Object oriented view:* which means it consists of one or more cooperating classes, it includes defining interfaces that makes said classes to communicate and cooperate,

- *Conventional view:* simply explained as taking internal data structure that make up the processing logic and the interface enables that data to be passed to it 

- *Process-related view:* basically is rather than creating components manually, the system builds components from a library maintained in the system, then they are used to help create the rest of the logic

### What are the characteristics of a component?

* **Reusability** − the main purpose for components to be reusable, however some components can or will be used for one task

* **Replaceable** − they are easily replaceable with similar components

* **Not context specific** − which means they are designed to work in any environment 

* **Extensible** − this one self explanatory which means you can extend a component from another component

* **Encapsulated** − it works with a certain called functionality by the interface without revealing the entire architecture in order for it to work

* **Independent** − they work separately without relying on other components

### What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

There many advantages to using component based architecture and to name a few:

1- Ease of deployment − when a new version is released it is easier to replace one component without having to change the whole software.

2- Reduced cost − using them helps cut down the cost of developing and maintaining your software.

3- Ease of development − you can develop certain parts of the software without having to affect the whole software in any way.

3- Reusable − no need to explain anything here, they are simply reusable.

4- Modification of technical complexity − A component edits anything complex through its services that are kept in the component container

5- Reliability − The whole software becomes more reliable because all the components work together smoothly thus increasing reliability.

6- System maintenance and evolution − again when each component container is handled separately it will be easier to maintain and upgrade softwares with less time and resources.

7- Independent − because components allow separate development, it will give you more freedom as a developer to expand and grow your software and interface individually.

## What is “Props” and how to use it in React?

### What are props short for?

Props is used to pass data from one component to another and is short for **Properties** 

### How are props used in React?

> *1-Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)*

> *2- Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props*

>3- *Finally, render the Props Data*

 ### What is the flow of props?
 props flow in one direction,they are passed through the parent component to the child component
