## React and Forms

### React Docs - Forms

- What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

*An input form element whose value is controlled by React*


- Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

*I think we should wait to store the user inputs from the form because the form inputs uncontrolled What this means is that React doesn’t track the input’s state. HTML input elements naturally keep track of their own state as part of the DOM, and so when the form is submitted we have to read the values from the DOM elements themselves.*

- How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

*Since the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be this.state.value, making the React state the source of truth. Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types, With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.*

### The Conditional (Ternary) Operator

- Why would we use a ternary operator?

*We use the ternary operator to simplify your if-else statements that are used to assign values to variables. The ternary operator is commonly used when assigning post data or validating forms.*

- Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

        if(x===y){
        console.log(true);
         } else {
        console.log(false);
        }

        x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
