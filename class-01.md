# Welcome to my first ready of the 201 class

## This read wil be about the following

* ### HTML structure

* ### Markup

* ### HTML layout

* ### Process and Design

* ### The ABC's of programming

------------------------------------------------------

## 1- HTML Structure

*Before we dig deep into the current HTML structure, let us talk a little bit about the history of HTML*.

The first HTML was introduce to the world back in 1993 by **Tim Berners-Lee** then through the early 2000's HTML 4.01 was the offical standard for the world.

Now what makes up an HTML document

A- The **!DOCTYPE html** which is a  declaration that defines that this document is an HTML5 document


B- The **html** element is the root element of an HTML page


C- The **head** element contains meta information about the HTML page


D- The **title** element specifies a title for the HTML page

E- The **body** element that defines the document's body, which is everything the user sees and interacts with

F- The **h1** element that defines a large heading

G- The **P** element defines a paragraph

## Each HTML structure can hold tags and attributes

*we can learn from this example that this HTML element has an attribute which in return must consist of an attribute name and an attribute value, and the tag must have a start and an end, all of these combined work together to tell the browser what to show to the user in which we name "affected contet"

Here's an example of an HTML structure for a webpage

## 2- Moving on to markup

We have learned before that HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, now what is a Markup wnad how can we benifit from it the most?

Markup is a text structered in a specific format that allows the users to orgnize and imorove data onn the webpage

and to be able to achieve that there has to be plenty of elements, tags and attributes within it to help reduce the gap between the machine readable text and the text that is understood by humans and to name a few of them there's _**meta, ! doctype, comments, ID attributes, class attributes, block elements, inline elemenets, iframe, src, hight, width, frame border, seamless and escape charachters**_ 

all of these are very easy tools to undertand and utilize in your web programming process, but to do so you must understand how a propper HTML layout must flow

----------------------------------

## 3- HTML Layout

>HTML Layouts. HTML layouts provide a way to arrange web pages in well-mannered, well-structured, and in responsive form or we can say that HTML layout specifies a way in which the web pages can be arranged. Web-page layout works with arrangement of visual elements of an HTML document.

Now that we understood the points that stand behind HTML, HTML structure, HTML layout and why we should follow the strict rules of implementing them let us talk about the process of creating a webpage and how to design it

## 4- Process and Design

In order to create a successful website we must plan every step of the way, first we should collect simple yet valuabe data such as

* __Target audience__: It tells us who is this website made for?

* __Why would people visit my website?__ It tells us wheather this website chnges content daily like a newspapper website or is it mainly a static website 

* __Site map__: Helps us orgnise our content and deliver what we want the visitors to see in an orgnised manner 

* __Wireframe__: It's simply a sketch of what would the final design look like, it's like an engineers blueprint, it works like a nice guidline to follow during the website building process

        let's not forget that design is about communication, between the designer and the end user, it should be clear and easy on the eyes by utilizing colors, styles, grouping, and sizes of everything on the webpage

------------------------------

## 5- The ABC's of programming

### - A) What is script? and how do I creat one?

A script is a programming language that is translated to machine code
and in ordeer to create a healthy script I need to define the goal of the script then design the script and code each step of the way carefully and neatly

### -B) Understanding how do computers fit in the world them!

Computers are logical machines that exist in a random world, and here comes our role as programmers, is to help these machines understand what is going around them either by coding everyting or via machine learning, we are now heading towrads a new era of AI which requires a lot of effort in multiple directions of machine learning, it's not easy and we don't know which path is the correct one but for now we are as humans making a positive progress, if we look around us we can see that machines are now detecting faces easily, autonomous cars are doing well, and airplanes' auto pilots are functoning perfectly

### -C) How do I write a script for a webpage?

A webpage needs three different contents to work, a skeleton which is the HTML, The design which is the CSS and finally the functioning side which is the Javasript

Each of them has it's own file and format and we link them together, and it is important to keep them orgnized and neatly coded, once we mastered this preocess the webpage should load and function without any problems.
