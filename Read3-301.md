## Passing Functions as Props

### React Docs - lists and keys

**What does .map() return?**

*we use the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values. We assign the new array returned by map() to the variable doubled and log it*

**If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?**

*we loop through the numbers array using the JavaScript map() function. We return a < li > element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to* **listItems**

**Each list item needs a unique** _< li > < /li> tag.


**What is the purpose of a key?**  

*A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity*

### The Spread Operator

**What is the spread operator?**

*The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax (…) for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.*

**List 4 things that the spread operator can do.**

- Concatenating or combining arrays

- Using an array as arguments

- Adding to state in React

- Converting NodeList to an array


**Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.**

const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']

const moreFruits = [...fruits];

console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]


fruits[0] = '🍑'


console.log(...[...fruits,'...',...moreFruits]) //  🍑 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍 ... 🍏 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍

**Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.**

const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']

const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]

console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]

**Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.**

const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]

const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]

const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]

console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩

### How to Pass Functions Between Components

**In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?**

He should increment and pass inide it the object from the function, then he uses the map function 

**In your own words, what does the increment function do?**

it helps us know what is the next node is at the same level. and from there it increase the level of that node by one at a from that level.

**How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?**

first we define our parent callback function in our parent component,then we pass the function to the child component, after that we set up an input variable in child component and last thing all the callback function.

**How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?**
 
 By using "this" method that calls the method that was passed to it from the parent component.
