# What Google Learned About Teams

Many companies struggled with building the perfect teams, because as we all know teamwork is a main part of successm it makes the job 10 times easier and more efficiant

so google came to realize that quickly and became focused on building the perfect team, they spent millions of dollars on measuring and studying their employees lives, they developed a department called Google's People operations department, that specialized in figuiring out everything related to employees from dining together to which traits good managers share

they figured out that most productive employees tend to spend tend to build larger networks by rotating dinner companions, and what we take for granted today as a piece of information like good communication and avoiding micromanagement is critical for success was a shocking information to them like it was news for google managers


> The company’s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well, like ‘‘It’s better to put introverts together,’’ said Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics division, or ‘‘Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.’’ But, Dubey went on, ‘‘it turned out no one had really studied which of those were true.’

in 2012 google launched an initiative called **Project-Aristole** that studied hundreds of google teams to try and understand why some teams were successful and others were less acheiving, the project had the best statisticians, organizational psychologists, sociologists and engineers, they worked day and night and made diagrams of every factor possible like gender, age, ethnicity, diversity, working hours, balancing work and personal life but it all didn't matter in the final outcome, 

after looking at thousands of records over one year span they noticed that while some norms were successful with some teams the same norms were a reason for failure of other teams , they eventually pinpointed where things matter the most, which was **psychological safety** which means according to them is removing fear from human interaction and replacing it with respect and permission

> ‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’

and thanks to Project Aristotle not only google, or tech companies but every company in the world now knows how important **psychological safety** to help build the perfect team
