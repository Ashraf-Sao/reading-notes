**Growth Mindset**

Growth mindset is a mental exercise to help you become a better person. How do you ask? Let me explain to you through these points.

1. Growth mindset helps you become more productive. If you feel more productive you will start to feel better about yourself, at first it might seem hard but in the long run it will give you that rewarding feeling.

 2. Growth mindset will make you a better teammate. If you truely keep a growth mindset you will start to take a critisim as a positive building block to your work and you will not be intimidated by the success of others, but instead you will be inspired by it.

 3. Maintainning a growth mindset helps you appreciate your efforts, because without them you will see it they will seem as fruitless efforts, but the with correct growth mindset, you will start to sense the No Pain No Gain attitude in your guts.

 4. Challenges will be more fun as you will start to embrace them instead of avoiding them.
