linux is universal OS that can be used to save time and effort

it requires shortcuts like ls for List or cd for changing directory

it's case sensitive

everything inisde linux is a file

there's more than shortcut to access the same file

bash stands for Bourne Again Shell

there are two paths absolute and relative 

Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory 

Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system.
