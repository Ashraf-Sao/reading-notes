# layout

we talked before on how css treats each element in the webpage as a block or inline element, and when another block is inside another block we call it parent element 

there are three positioning tricks to help us control the layout 

* Normal flow: every block lays on top of the other 

* relative positioning : like normal flow but can be positioned left or right

* absolute positioning: this positions the element in relation to its containing element and moves as the user scrolls up and down the page

* fixed positioning: this positions the element in relation to the browser window 

floating elements: floating an element allows us to move the element to the far left or the far right

when we position we must take in a consederation screen reolution,  screen size, page size, fixed width layout, liquid layout, fixed width layout, liquid layout, and layout grids

# functions 

browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.

Question: What is a function?

Answer : a function is number of statements that tells the browser to perform a specific task

Question: how to create a function?

answer: to create a function first you name it, then you write the statements rquired to make it run the task

Question: how do you call a function?

answer: after creating the function, and declaring it you execute the function 

sometimes a function need some sort of information to perform its task, and we call that function when we specify the values it needs, some of these functions return values to the user like calculations, and other functions return multiple values 

local variables, is when the var is inside the function and global variables is when the vae is outside the functions

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Greater efficiency: instead of doing the whole project alone, you can pair with someone and do a better job in half the time

2. Engaged collaboration: when you have someone relying on you 
it is less likely to get distracted or delay your work thus increasing productivity

3. Learning from fellow students: in shorter terms two heads are better than one, one programmer might find difficulty solving a problem but pariring with some ome would benift both parties one might offer problem soliving and the other might offer more experience in coding

4. Social skills: it teaches communication and builds team work which is a quality that companies are looking for in an employee, as well as it improves their social skills 

5. Job interview readiness: companies usually makes the applicant pair with a programmer of their own to build a project, and usually the job goes for the applicant with the ability to fit in a team with strong social skills rather than the applicant with the most experience


6. Work environment readiness: it makes your first job after graduating less intimidating and you'll be confident to start earning and leaning at the same time
